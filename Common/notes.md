## Notes
- I have replaced `import Keras` with `import tensorflow.keras` 
    - The `import Keras` did not worked in my device, I do not have an explanation!
- CSV creation unit-tests are commented out and moved to code-snippets.txt file!
- If you update tensorflow, the import tensorflow.keras will not work, you have to do import tensorflow.keras instead..
